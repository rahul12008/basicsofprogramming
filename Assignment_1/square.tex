\textbf{\textsl{1. Prove that the points (0,1),(1,4),(4,3),(3,0) are the vertices of a Square  :}}

\vspace{1cm}

 Answer- 
 \\ Step1 : Find the distance between all the four points.  
 \\ Distance between two points is :
 $$ distance = \sqrt{((x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2)}$$
\\ From the above points , we get six distances between the points.
 and if four distances length are equal and two distance length are equal, then it is a square.

\\ Conditions to be a Square :
\\ 1. All the lengths of the sides of Square must be equal.
$$ 2. diagonal \hspace{0.1cm} length =\sqrt{2} X Side length$$
 $$4.47213595499958 =\sqrt{2} X 3.1622776601683795$$
\\As these points obey above conditions , Hence they form a Square.
